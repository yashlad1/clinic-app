/**
 * EAS Observe, made optional at runtime.
 *
 * `expo-observe` is a native module: importing it calls `requireNativeModule`
 * at module scope, so in a binary that does not contain it the import itself
 * throws and the whole app fails to start - which is what happened. Expo Go
 * does not contain it, and section 4 makes Expo Go the entire dev loop on this
 * project: no emulator system image was even complete until today, and there
 * is no local JDK 17.
 *
 * So this detects the MODULE rather than the environment. Checking for Expo Go
 * specifically would also disable Observe inside a development build, which
 * does ship the native module and is exactly where you would want metrics
 * while testing. A try/catch answers the only question that matters: is it
 * actually here?
 *
 * In Expo Go the two exports below become no-ops. Nothing else in the app
 * knows the difference.
