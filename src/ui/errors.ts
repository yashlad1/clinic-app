/**
 * Turning failures into sentences a clinician can act on.
 *
 * The rule that shapes every message here: SAY WHETHER THE DATA WAS SAVED.
 *
 * A silent failure is the worst outcome this app can produce. If a tap does
 * nothing and says nothing, she reasonably assumes the dose was recorded, and
 * recorded stock begins drifting from the fridge - which is failure mode 2, the
 * thing the whole append-only design exists to prevent. So an error message
 * that ends "Nothing was saved." is doing more work than one that merely says
 * something went wrong.
 *
 * Raw constraint text is never shown. "SQLITE_CONSTRAINT: UNIQUE constraint
 * failed: vaccines.name" is not a sentence, and it is frightening.
