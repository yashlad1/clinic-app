 * Tells you when uploading has stopped working, without being asked.
 *
 * Uploading is automatic, so nobody should need to find a button. The failure
 * that mattered was the SILENT one: sync quietly not working for hours while
 * the More tab - which nobody opens mid-clinic - was the only place that said
 * so.
 *
 * Non-modal and never blocking, like the backup banner. It sits above the
 * search field on the dose screen, so it is seen without being in the way of
 * recording a dose. Invariant 5 is not negotiable: this must never stand
 * between the clinician and a vaccination.
