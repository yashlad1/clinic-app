/**
 * When to say out loud that entries have not reached the server.
 *
 * Uploading is automatic - after each entry, on opening the app, and every 15
 * minutes - so in normal use this says nothing at all. It exists for the case
 * where automatic uploading is quietly NOT working: no signal for hours, wrong
 * credentials, a server that has gone away. Nobody should have to go looking
 * through menus to discover that.
 *
 * Deliberately silent during ordinary operation. An indicator that appears for
 * four seconds after every dose is noise, and noise is how a real warning gets
 * ignored. So it waits until entries are genuinely stranded.
