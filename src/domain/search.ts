/**
 * One matcher for every search box in the app.
 *
 * There were three, all hand-rolled `includes()` on the name, and all of them
 * ignored `aliases` - a column the schema carries FOR SEARCH and nothing else.
 * The one alias-aware query in the codebase, `searchVaccines`, was used only by
 * its own test. So "dpt" found nothing, while the data to find it was sitting
 * in the row.
 *
 * Three things a clinic search has to survive:
 *
 *   Punctuation. "Td (UIP)" and "Tresivac (MMR)" are real catalog names, and
 *   typing "td uip" or "mmr" must find them. Everything is normalised down to
 *   letters and digits, so brackets, dots and hyphens stop mattering.
 *
 *   Word starts. Typing "tetra" should find "Vaxigrip Tetra". A plain
 *   substring test does that too, but it cannot tell that "rota" matching
 *   "Rotavac" at the FRONT is a better answer than matching mid-word - and a
 *   grid sorted alphabetically buries the obvious one.
 *
 *   Several words. "vaxi tetra" is how people type when they half-remember a
 *   name. Every token has to land somewhere, in any order.
