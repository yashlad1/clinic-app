/**
 * Push-only replication.
 *
 * The phone stays the source of truth; the server is a live off-phone copy. So
 * this never reads from the server during normal operation and never merges -
 * which removes conflict resolution from the design entirely, and with it the
 * class of bug that would be hardest to notice and worst to have.
 *
 * Two ordering rules that are correctness, not tidiness:
 *
 *  1. Tables push in FK order (vaccines and patients before the movements that
 *     reference them), so the server never holds a movement whose vaccine has
 *     not arrived yet. A half-pushed phone is still a readable clinic record.
 *  2. `dirty` is cleared only AFTER the server acknowledges. A push that
 *     succeeds and then loses the response is retried and lands on the row id
 *     again, which is a no-op. The failure mode is therefore "uploaded twice",
 *     never "believed uploaded but wasn't".
